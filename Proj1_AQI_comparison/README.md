#### Explore Reasons Behind Dramatic Difference between two Air Quality Index (AQI) reported by U.S. and China

##### Plan of approach
1. Get the data from both governments and pre-process data to derive the difference of AQI's
2. Data understanding, data pre-processing and data visualization
3. Subtract the mean of the difference time series and test the stationarity test
4. Seasonal Trend Decomposition assuming additive model

##### Sources of Data
